# Election Twiter Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains the code for the web app created to analyze real-time tweet sentiments that are posted about democractic candidates.

## Ideas
There are a few ideas that i need to consider. For instance,

* The number of positive and negative tweets posted for each candidate
* The proportion of positivity and negativity
* How these change over time and possibly after each debate or major event
* Is there any relationship between the tweets sentiments and the pols?
* The location of the sentiments, broken down to the states, possibly focusing on the swing states.
* We can expand the analysis beyond the tweets and to the users/voters.
* Make a word cloud for the tweets about each candidate?
